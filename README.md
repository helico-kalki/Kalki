# Kalki Image Manipulation Program
Kalki is a python-built, light image manipulation program aiming an intuitive design, rather than functionality.

This program is 90% AI - I am not good at coding and actually not even in ambition to change this.

The reason I wanted to create an image manipulation program was designing my own - all textures (and the layout) are by myself. In uploading this, I hope to see my vision take shape in the hands of the internet. This project also willingly does not have any copyright, you do not have to give me credit, just don't be evil making profit of something that's not supposed to do so.

## Installation
You'll need PyQt6 and Pillow.

Press the arrow on the green code button, download the zip, get the folder out of the zip-File.

You probably will need to type this into the Terminal (Visual Studio Code):

- pip install pyqt6

- pip install pillow

If not working, try py -m pip install (...)

To start, just open the gui.py file.
