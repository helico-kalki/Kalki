# Kalki Image Manipulation Program
Kalki is a python-built, light image manipulation program aiming an intuitive design, rather than functionality.

This program is 90% AI - I am not good at coding and actually not even in ambition to change this.

The reason I wanted to create an image manipulation program was designing my own - all textures (and the layout) are by myself.

## GUI

As seen on the screen shot, Kalki consists of a top actionbar, the white canvas and the task/toolbar.

## Actionbar
- New (Clear Canvas)
- Import (Open File)
- Export Canvas (Save)

- Copy/Paste
- Zoom In/Zoom Out
- Effects (12 Options)
## Taskbar
- Move Selection
- Rectangular Selection
- Circular Selection
- Lasso Selection (not working quite yet)

- Eraser (White Pen)
- Pen Thickness Slider
- Pick Color

- Fill Canvas with selected Color
- Fill Canvas with two-color gradient (left to right)

## Installation
You'll need PyQt6 and Pillow

If not working, try py -m pip install (...)

To start, just open the gui.py file.
